        - Customer Creation
      summary: Create a new customer
      description: |
        Creates a new customer in the ERPNext system with optional contact and address information.
        
        ### What Gets Created
        
        When you call this endpoint, the following records are created in ERPNext:
        
        1. **Customer Document** (Always created)
           - Customer ID (auto-generated or uses customer_name)
           - Customer Type (Individual or Company)
           - Customer Group (from parameter or system default)
           - Territory (from parameter or system default)
        
        2. **Contact Document** (Created if email, mobile, or phone is provided)
           - Linked to the customer
           - Set as primary contact
           - Email address(es)
           - Phone number(s)
           - Email and mobile will appear on customer card
        
        3. **Address Document** (Created if address fields are provided)
           - Linked to the customer
           - Address Type: Billing
           - Full address with all provided fields
           - Country validation included
        
        ### Features
        - ✅ **Duplicate Detection**: Automatically checks if customer name already exists
        - ✅ **Contact Linking**: Contact information automatically linked to customer
        - ✅ **Address Linking**: Address automatically linked to customer
        - ✅ **Default Values**: Uses system defaults for customer group and territory if not provided
        - ✅ **Validation**: Validates customer type, country, and required fields
        - ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with rollback on failures
        - ✅ **Multiple Phones**: Supports both mobile and phone numbers
        
        ### Business Logic
        - If customer name already exists, returns error without creating duplicate
        - Contact is only created if at least one of: email, mobile, or phone is provided
        - Address is only created if at least one of: address_line1, city, or country is provided
        - Customer Type must be either "Individual" or "Company"
        - Default Customer Group: "All Customer Groups" (or from Selling Settings)
        - Default Territory: "All Territories" (or from Selling Settings)
